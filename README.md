# CllickUp-Demo-for-ACME
This repo is just a small demo I put together to show how ClickUp integrates with GitHub.   Iâ€™ll be using it to create branches, commits, and pull requests that link back to ClickUp tasks.   The idea is to simulate what a real engineering team (like Acme Co.) would see if they were using ClickUp with GitHub.
